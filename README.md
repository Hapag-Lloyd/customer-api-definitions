# customer-api-definitions

This repository contains all API definitions which are useful for our customers. At the moment the plain OpenAPI definitions are
published here and also made available as a Maven artifact.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hlag.api</groupId>
    <artifactId>openapi-specs</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST VERSION HERE</version>
</dependency>
```

We plan to generate Java clients in the future and publish them as well.
